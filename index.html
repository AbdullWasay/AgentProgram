INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT 

This Independent Contractor Agreement ("Agreement") is between Match merchants, Inc. with offices at 115 Broad Street New York, NY ("MM") and the entity and/or individual whose name and address are set forth in the online registration and payment form (hereinafter referred to as "Independent Contractor"). 

RECITALS 

WHEREAS, Independent Contractor engages in the business of marketing services to business entities that accept credit cards as payment for goods and services; and 
WHEREAS, MM  wishes to expand its market share by retaining Independent Contractor to assist in marketing its credit card, debit card, gift card, loyalty card, leasing, ACH, POS equipment, software and related good and services (the "MM Services") and Independent Contractor wishes to undertake certain duties and responsibilities for marketing the MM Services. 
NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 

AGREEMENT 

SECTION ONE - MARKETING THE MMS SERVICES 

1.01. Appointment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, MM hereby appoints Independent Contractor as a reseller of the MM Services. In connection with such appointment, MM grants Independent Contractor a non-transferable right to promote market and solicit orders for the MM Services from businesses wishing to utilize the MM Services ("Merchants"). Independent Contractor shall identify prospective Merchants that meet MM's criteria as set forth in this Agreement and its general policies and procedures. Independent Contractor will obtain all information and documentation reasonably required by MM. Independent Contractor shall promptly provide MM with the current address of each of its offices and the offices of its agents. 

1.02. Approval of Merchants. Independent Contractor acknowledges that all Merchants are to be approved by MM in their sole discretion and Merchants will be able to utilize the MMS Services effective only upon such approval. Therefore, Independent Contractor will not make any promise to or create any impression with a prospective Merchant that it will be approved prior to review and approval. Further, Independent Contractor acknowledges that all aspects of the MM Services are subject to the management and approval of MM and its vendors and Independent Contractor shall make no representations to the contrary. 

1.03. MM Services Agreement. Merchants will be presented by MM or Independent Contractor with an online or written application and/or agreement that will govern the relationship between the Merchants, MM and its vendors in regard to the MM Services ("Merchant Agreement"). Independent Contractor shall use only that form of Merchant Agreement that has been approved and supplied by MM. Independent Contractor shall not make any changes or modifications to any Merchant Agreement without the prior written consent of MM. MM reserves the right to amend or change in any manner the agreements between Merchants, MM, and its vendors to be used by Independent Contractor, including changes to any and all fees due from Merchants. 

1.04. Acceptable Merchants. Independent Contractor shall market the MM Services only to bona fide and lawful businesses and in accordance with MM's and its vendors' policies, procedures and standards and this Agreement. Further, Independent Contractor shall promptly notify MM in writing of any adverse information that Independent Contractor receives relating to a Merchant, including information regarding a Merchant's financial condition or any other information relating to Merchant that would have a material effect on Merchant's ability to conform to the terms of its agreements. 

1.05. Independent Contractors. The relationship of MM and Independent Contractor is that of independent contractors. Neither Independent Contractor nor Independent Contractor's employees, consultants, contractors or agents are agents, employees, partners or joint ventures of MM, nor do they have any authority to bind MMS by contract or otherwise to any obligation. They will not represent to the contrary, either expressly, implicitly, by appearance or otherwise. 

1.06. Compliance with Laws/Marketing Materials. Independent Contractor agrees to comply with the rules and regulations of Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express and all other such associations, as they may exist from time to time, and the rules and regulations of any debit network or federal or state department or agency having jurisdiction over the activities of MM or Independent Contractor ("Rules"). In the event of any inconsistency between any provision of this Agreement and the Rules, the Rules shall govern. Independent Contractor hereby agrees to accept and abide by any amendments and revisions to the Rules. Independent Contractor will comply with all applicable international, national, state, regional and local laws and regulations in performing its duties hereunder and in any of its dealings with respect to the MM Services. Independent Contractor shall use only those marketing and promotional materials that comply with the Rules and all United States, state, local and any other applicable laws or regulations. 


1.07. Independent Contractor Covenants. Independent Contractor will: (i) conduct business in a manner that reflects favorably at all times on the MM Services and the good name, good will and reputation of MM; (ii) avoid deceptive, misleading or unethical practices that are or might be detrimental to MM, the MM Services or the public; (iii) make no false or misleading representations with regard to MM or the MM Services; (iv) not publish or employ, or cooperate in the publication or employment of, any misleading or deceptive advertising material with regard to MM or the MM Services; (v) promote proper use of MM Services, and (v) make no representation, warranties or guarantees to potential Merchants with respect to the specifications, features or capabilities of the MM Services that are inconsistent with the literature distributed by MM. 

1.08. Registration. (a) In the event that Independent Contractor chooses to market the MM Services under Independent Contractor's own company name or brand, Independent Contractor will request that MM provide access to registration. Independent Contractor acknowledges that authorization for registration as an ISO (Visa) or MSP (MasterCard) is at the discretion of MM vendors. Independent Contractor agrees that MM is not responsible for Independent Contractor's acceptability as an ISO or MSP and that MM will only act as a conduit to assist Independent Contractor in the registration process. In the event that Independent Contractor's application for ISO or MSP status is denied, Independent Contractor acknowledges that this Agreement shall remain valid. 
(b) Independent Contractor agrees and understands that in the event Independent Contractor does not become a registered ISO/MSP, Independent Contractor MUST market all MM Services under one of MM brand names. In such case, Independent Contractor shall answer all phones and present business cards, letterhead, brochures, marketing materials and especially its website with one of the names owned by MM. 
(c) Independent Contractor shall not alter any Merchant Agreement or merchant application, including, but not limited to, by removing any logos or identifying information.
